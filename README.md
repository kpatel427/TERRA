# TERRA

Telomeric length maintenance is a hallmark of cancer and it is maintained by two mututally exclusive mechanisms:
Re-activation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
Activation of Alternative Lengthenung if Telomeres (ALT) pathway

ALT is usually activated by loss of function of ATRX gene.
TERRA - telomeric repeat containing RNA, a non-coding RNA transcribed from telomeric DNA by RNA polymerase II
TERRA expression and increased telomere DNA abundance suggests activation of ALT independently of ATRX status. 

The script counts reads containing telomeric repeats.
